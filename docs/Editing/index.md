# Setup
## Standard
Your project must be structured in the way that Roku expects, which looks something like this:

```graphql
./workspaceFolder/
  ├─ manifest
  ├─ components/
  │ ├─ HomeScene.brs
  │ └─ HomeScene.xml
  └─ source/
    └─ main.brs
```

## Subdirectory
If your project lives in a subdirectory, you will need to create a `bsconfig.json` file at the root of your project, and reference your subdirectory like such:

```json
{
  "rootDir": "./someSubdir"
}
```

This project relies heavily on the [brighterscript](https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript) project for language server support. See [this link](https://github.com/rokucommunity/brighterscript#bsconfigjson-options) to view the `bsconfig.json` options.
