## Telemetry
The extension collects a small amount of telemetry data, focused on how frequently certain features are being used. We do not collect any user-specific information. This data is also incredibly useful when requesting new features from Roku, as real-world usage carries a lot more weight than simple conjecture. 

To make things as transparent as possible, we have tried to keep all telemetry logic confined to [this file](https://github.com/rokucommunity/vscode-brightscript-language/blob/master/src/managers/TelemetryManager.ts). Feel free to open an issue if you have any questions or concerns. 

### Opting out of telemetry tracking
If you would like to disable telemetry tracking, you can follow [these instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/telemetry#_disable-telemetry-reporting) from the VSCode docs.
